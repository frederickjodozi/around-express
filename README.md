# *around-express: My sixth project at TripleTen*
This is my first Backend project. It consists of a very simple Express.js App that is connected to a MongoDB database to create, read, update and delete data. 

## *Features*
The project notably includes:  
- Routes for both user and location data.
- The use of the most common http methods such as 'get', 'post', 'patch', 'put' and 'delete'.
- Custom Controllers to modify data.
- Custom Error codes.
- Data models using Mongoose Schemas.

## *Contributions*
Since the project has no Frontend interface to interact with, it is not hosted on GitHub Pages.  
  
It can be best used by students beggining their journey in Backend development by being cloned to a local machine and ran in conjunction on Localhost and an Api Platform like Postman.  
  
Students should note that they will need to install and connect their own databases to the cloned project to make it work.  

  
**Thanks to TripleTen for helping me build the project!**
