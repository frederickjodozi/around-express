## My sixth Practicum project

This is my first backend project in the Practicum program. It consists of a simple app connected to a database to create, read, update and delete data. 

Since the project as no frontend interface to interact with, it is best used by running on localhost and using an api platform like Postman for request and response testing. It will serve as a basis for future full stack projects.
